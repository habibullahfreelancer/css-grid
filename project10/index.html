        <div class="grandfather">
          <p>
            Grandfather's creaky as his front porch, loads his shotgun beneath
            the awning, spittoon restless for rain, carpenter's chair against
            the whistling air. Rocking, back and forth, rocking snap shot
            picture - worth it, just like the movies
          </p>
          <p>This is a song by Levi The Poet</p>

          She said that he loved baseball, and James Earl Jones; said that he's
          got god talking inside of his thoughts while he's rounding those bases
          on his way back home

        <p class="pad10 large10">"If you build it, they will come"</p>
        <p class="pad10">
          If you build it, they will come (and baby listens to what the Lord
          say). But I've been getting pretty worn, building for nearly a decade
        </p>
        <p class="pad10">
          In a perfect world we shouldn’t have been allowed to lose sight of
          what it means to love wholly. I’ve got a Polaroid hanging on my wall
          that a friend took of me and my angel. I remember the day like it’s
          something I can touch, but it’s stuck in the square between the
          borders of the film, and I can run my fingers over our faces, but I
          can’t get back to the places we were
        </p>
        <p class="pad10 large10">You’ve got a pain deep in your bones, son.</p>
        <p class="pad10">
          "You’ve got a pain deep in your bones, son. It compels you forward
          like you’re tied to a slave master’s cruel hand, and it's the same
          pain that drives that oppressor’s heart of stone, so you’ve grown to
          love the man. You keep pouring yourself out, again and again, into
          legible lines through a crooked pen." Yeah, it’s painful, but it’s
          familiar – so habit breeds comfort, and I don’t know what I’d do
          without him

           So in the early morning, when you’ve fallen asleep in our home, I drift back into the memories that I’ve claimed as my own, and wonder if tonight will be a night I’ll hang on my wall like I did before we stopped taking photos, out of the habit of being comfortable with not trying at all

        <p class="large10">Dear Time</p>
        <p class="pad10">
          Grandfather's as creaky as his front porch, scent like oil in the gun
          barrel, dip-can kicked over the railing, sandpaper hands stuck behind
          thumb tacks on my wall. I’ve got an ache in my chest for every season
          I miss and it gets worse when the snow starts to fall. There are
          butterflies alive in that couple’s eyes a few years since forgotten by
          all, and sometimes, if the phone starts to ring, I can still hear
          their wings when you call
        </p>

        <p class="pad10">
          But I begged for movement and I got what I asked for, and I can
          picture the answer like it came yesterday. And in the land of the
          gods, I think that things are timeless, but we are still prone to
          decay
        </p>

        <p class="pad10">
          You know I still lift up hope of certain smiles in those photos for us
          when I pray
        </p>

        <p class="pad10 large10">
          "Idle hands build nothing that you can call your own"
        </p>

        <p class="pad10">
          Time is a cruel lover, and she breaks her house apart at its bones.
          You know comfort is no good reason for standing still, and idle hands
          build nothing that you can call your own.
        </p>
